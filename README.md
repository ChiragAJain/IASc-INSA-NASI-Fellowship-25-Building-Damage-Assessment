# Summer Fellowship Research Programme (SRFP - 25)
Every Year, three science academia - Indian Academy of Science (IASc), Indian National Science Academy (INSA), and The National Academy of Science (NASI) conduct a paid summer fellowship programme where in undergraduate students and professors are selected based upon their academic performance, projects, extra-curricular activities, and recommendations. Under this programme, the selected individuals are to work on research projects under a academy guide residing in diffierent academic research institutes across India. <br>

Under this fellowship, I worked under Dr. Venkadachalam Ramesh (Dept. of Mathematics, Central University of Tamil Nadu) on a research project titled, *Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network Models for Disaster Damage Assessment of Buildings*. Herein, I proposed a lightweight CNN model useful for embedded systems such as drones and UAVs to assess post-disaster damage to a building which could help notify Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Recovery Operations (HADR) to provide quick aid to individuals in dire need.
